********************************************************************************
**	Notes:
**	1.  The model is designed to be accurate over the ranges presented in the
**	    corresponding datasheet typical characteristic curves.
**	2.  The model is valid over the 25C to 175C temperature range.
**	3.  Reverse leakage currents are modeled as a breakdown voltage at 250uA.
**	    No low current detail is provided.
**	4.  The surge response of the PiN structure is not included in this 
**          version.
**	5.  Recombination current is assumed to be zero.
**	6.  Currently, the model is electrical only. No thermal model is included.
**	7.  LT Spice users: please note that a LTSpice symbol library is also 
**	    available. Please refer to the file "Cree_C4D_CPW4_LTSPICE_Symbols.zip" 
**	    for further details.
